    <strong><em>This easy version keeps things nice and easy with penne pasta, chicken, and that creamy Alfredo sauce we all love.</em></strong>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Penne pasta</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Milk + cream</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Use leftover chicken or pan fry it for a couple of minutes until done.
            </p><em>10 ounces penne pasta</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute.
            <p><em>3 cups diced cooked chicken, 1½ teaspoons minced garlic, 2 tablespoons flour</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the milk and cream in batches, then simmer, whisking constantly, until the sauce has just thickened. The sauce is ready when it coats the back of a wooden spoon.
            <p><em>2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Season with salt and black pepper.
            <p><em>salt and pepper</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in parmesan. Stir continuously until the cheese is melted..
            <p><em>¾ cup grated parmesan cheese</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine pasta, and chicken and pour in the sauce. Combine and mix well until all the paste is nicely coated in the sauce mixture.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>Grease a baking dish (I used 8x11) lightly with oil or butter. Transfer half of the pasta mixture to the dish and top with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat with one more layer of pasta and cheese.
            <p><em>3 tablespoons butter, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, cooking oil spray</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes (uncovered), until cheese is melted and golden brown. Serve with fresh parsley.
            <p><em>2 tablespoon parsley</em></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
